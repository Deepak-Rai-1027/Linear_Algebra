# Linear_Algebra codes in Python and Matlab

The main purpose of this repository is to store all my Linear Algebra codes in Python & Matlab. Anyone who is interested in refering to these codes are free to do so for thier own learning. I am really facinated with the application of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning and will keep updating this repository in future.
